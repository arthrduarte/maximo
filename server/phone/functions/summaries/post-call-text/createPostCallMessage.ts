    - Acknowledge or show appreciation for the call that just ended without greeting the user
    - Key insights and realizations they had during the call

    - A motivational closing that references their strengths shown in the conversation

    If in this conversation you scheduled a next call with the user, mention it in the closing section.

    The message should be personal, encouraging, and specific to what was discussed.
    Use natural language and a professional tone suitable for SMS.
    Keep each section concise as these will be sent as separate text messages.
