                <p class="mb-4">We take the security of your Personal Information seriously. We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to maintain the security and privacy of Personal Information we collect and use. When disclosing Personal Information, you should remain mindful that there is always risk in sending Personal Information using the internet.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We may aggregate or de-identify Personal Information we collect through our Services and when operating our business so that it no longer identifies you. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code. Once information or data has been de-identified and/or aggregated, such information is no longer Personal Information. This means we may share it with third parties and may use this de-identified / aggregated data for our legitimate business purposes, such as for the purposes described above, to analyze the way our Services are being used, to improve and add features to them, and to conduct research.

The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.

                <p class="mb-4">If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section, and in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended. Please see the "Exercising Your Rights" sub-section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of your Personal Information shall control. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a></p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Access</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months. Assuming verification of your identity, we will provide you with the following information:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected about you.</li>
                    <li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Information was collected.</li>
                    <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing your Personal Information.</li>
                    <li>The categories of third-parties with whom we have shared your Personal Information.</li>
                    <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mb-4">If we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose over the past twelve (12) months, we will identify the categories of Personal Information shared with each category of third-party recipient.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">If we have sold your Personal Information over the past twelve (12) months, we will identify the categories of Personal Information purchased by each category of third-party recipient.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Deletion</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you (or your household). Note that this deletion right does not include Personal Information we have collected from third-party sources. Furthermore, under the CCPA, this deletion right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Information to provide you with services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Exercising Right To Access and/or Right to Deletion</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">If you are a California resident, and to exercise the rights described above, you (or someone acting under your express authorization) must send us a request that (a) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Information, and (b) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. If someone is submitting a request on your behalf, they must further (c) provide proof that they are authorized to act for you in this regard. In some cases, we may request additional information (such as your phone number or email address) in order to verify your request. If we cannot verify your identity, we will be unable to process your request to know/access, correct or delete.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a "Valid Request". We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We will work to respond to your Valid Request within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we are not able to respond to your request within forty-five (45) days, we will let you know that we may need additional time to respond, up to ninety (90) total days. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a></p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Opt-Out of "Sale" or "Sharing" of Personal Information</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">The CCPA defines "sale" to include sharing or disclosing of Personal Information with a third-party for monetary or other valuable consideration. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) further defines "sharing" as disclosing, making available, transferring, or communicating a consumer's Personal Information to a third party for "cross-context behavioral advertising", whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration. There are circumstances where disclosure of Personal Information with third-parties is not considered to be a sale. For example, we may disclose Personal Information with service providers who work on our behalf if the service provider agrees not to use that Personal Information for other purposes. In addition, you may intentionally direct us to disclose information to a third-party, which is also not a sale. The CCPA gives California residents the right to direct a business that sells or shares Personal Information about that consumer to third-parties not to sell or share such information. To this end, if you desire to opt out, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a> with the subject line "California Do Not Sell Request" as well as the name and email associated with the Personal Information. Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale or sharing of your Personal Information for at least twelve (12) months. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">The CCPA provides California residents with the right to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Information kept by businesses. Upon submission of a valid request by a California resident, and verification by us of the same, we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct inaccurate Personal Information identified by you.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">No Discrimination For Exercising Your Rights</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates, or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of persona data that we receive from you.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Authorized Agents</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Authorized agents may also submit requests to us in the same way that individuals can submit requests. We may request that any authorized agents verify their identity, including by providing information about themselves, such as their name, email, phone number, and address. We may also contact consumers directly to confirm the authority of the authorized agent.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">California Shine the Light Act</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of a company who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of Personal Information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding twelve (12) calendar months. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">California Invasion of Privacy Act</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">By using or accessing the Services, you hereby consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information consistent with this Privacy Policy, to the extent such information falls under any provision of the California Invasion of Privacy Act.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">15. Additional Information For Residents Of Other States</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Information to third-parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Information. You can exercise this right by contacting us at <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a> with the subject line "Nevada Do Not Sell Request" and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your Personal Information. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change. We will respond to verified requests within sixty (60) days after we receive the request and may need to extend our response by up to thirty (30) days.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">If you are a resident of a state in the United States not otherwise mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we shall use our best efforts to honor your request to either delete, restrict the use of your Personal Information and opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information with third parties. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">16. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We do not direct or target our Services to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected the Personal Information of anyone under the age of 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian of someone under the age of 13 and discover that your child has submitted Personal Information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@meetmaximo.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">team@meetmaximo.com</a>. We will make reasonable efforts to remove such information from our databases.</p>

If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (to the extent we have your email) or by means of a notice on the top of this Policy or the top of the website or within the Services.</p>
