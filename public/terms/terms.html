Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations included in these Terms OF USE may not apply to you. To the extent that Maximo may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth in these Terms OF USE, the scope of such warranty, and the extent of Maximo's liability, shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">9. Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Jury Trial</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Maximo and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms of Use or the use of any product or service provided by Maximo that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Maximo, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services or goods provided under the Terms of Use.

                <p class="mb-4">Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Maximo should be sent to: 7 Bayview Station Road, Ottawa, ON, K1Y 2C5. After the Notice is received, you and Maximo may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Maximo do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

                <p class="mb-4">Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms of Use. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek less than $500 in damages and comply with the Terms of Use, including the notice requirement set forth in Section 10.2, Maximo shall reimburse you for your AAA filing fee, and shall pay all administration and arbitrator fees up to a total amount of $500. If the Arbitrator grants you an award, the company will reimburse your attorney's fees.

                <p class="mb-4">Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.

                <p class="mb-4">Time Limits. If you or Maximo pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

                <p class="mb-4">Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Maximo, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Maximo.

                <p class="mb-4">Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Maximo in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND MAXIMO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

                <p class="mb-4">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

                <p class="mb-4">Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

                <p class="mb-4">Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

                <p class="mb-4">Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.

                <p class="mb-4">Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Maximo.

                <p class="mb-4">Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Maximo may bring an individual action in small claims court.

                <p class="mb-4">Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

                <p class="mb-4">Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California, for such purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">10. Termination</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Termination by Maximo. Maximo may terminate and/or suspend your use of the Services in accordance with these Terms of Use, including without limitation pursuant to Section 3, 4 and 11.

                <p class="mb-4">Termination of Services by You. If you want to terminate the Services provided by Maximo, you may do so by notifying Maximo at any time for all of the Services that you use. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Maximo's address set forth below.

                <p class="mb-4">Effect of Termination. Termination of any Services includes removal of access to such Services and barring of further use of the Services.

All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">11. Remedies</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Violations. If Maximo becomes aware of any possible violations by you of the Terms of Use, Maximo reserves the right to investigate such violations. If, as a result of the investigation, Maximo believes that criminal activity has occurred, Maximo reserves the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all applicable legal authorities. Maximo is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on or in the Services, including your Content, in Maximo's possession in connection with your use of the Services, to (i) comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to any claims that your Content violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Maximo, its customers and users or the public, and all enforcement or other government officials, as Maximo in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate.

                <p class="mb-4">Breach. In the event that Maximo determines, in its sole discretion, that you have breached any portion of the Terms of Use, or have otherwise demonstrated conduct inappropriate for the Services, Maximo reserves the right to:
                Warn you via e-mail (to any e-mail address you have provided to Maximo) that you have violated the Terms of Use;
                Delete any of your Content provided by you or your agent(s) to the Services;
                Discontinue your use or access of any of the Services;
                Notify and/or send Content to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for further action; and/or
                Pursue any other action which Maximo deems to be appropriate.
                No Subsequent Access. If your ability to access the Services is discontinued by Maximo due to your violation of any portion of the Terms of Use or for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the Services, then you agree that you shall not attempt to access the Services through any other means, including use of a different browser, name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those Services to which your access has been terminated. In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, Maximo reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">12. General Provisions</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Assignment. Maximo may assign or delegate these Terms of Use and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms of Use or Privacy Policy without Maximo's prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.

                <p class="mb-4">Severability. You and Maximo agree that if any Section of these Terms of Use or provision of the Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such Section or provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability in any other jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining Sections of the Terms of Use or provisions of the Privacy Policy, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.

                <p class="mb-4">Governing Law.  If you are a resident of the United States, these Terms of Use and any dispute arising out of or related to it or Privacy Policy or the Services shall be governed in all respects by California law, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

                <p class="mb-4">Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Maximo use electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send Maximo e-mails, or whether Maximo posts notices on the Services or communicates with you via e-mail.

                <p class="mb-4">No Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms of Use on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

                <p class="mb-4">Notices. Where Maximo requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Maximo with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Maximo is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms of Use, Maximo's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Maximo at the following address: 7 Bayview Station Road, Ottawa, ON, K1Y 2C5. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Maximo by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.
